## Overview

ctguard is a small host-based intrusion detection system ([hids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_based_intrusion_detection_system)) inspired by [ossec](https://www.ossec.net/).

Its current features are:

- rule based log analysis
- detection of filesystem object changes/additions/deletions
- intervening with custom actions

## Dependencies

To build ctguard, a c++17 compliant compiler and standard library is needed, e.g:

- GCC 7 and up
- Clang 5.0 and up

Also sqlite3 develepment headers are needed, on Debian supplied by the package `libsqlite3-dev`.

To build the manpages, [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) is required.

## Installation

### Debian

The simplest way to install ctguard on Debian (and derivates) is to build a package, by using the command `debuild -us -uc` from the package `devscripts`.
This generates a Debian package in the parent directory.
Simply install it with `dpkg -i ../ctguard_*.deb`.

ctguard can then be later deinstalled by `apt purge ctguard`.

### Generic

The first step is to build ctguard.
Run `make USERMODE=1 -j binaries` in the ctguard directory as normal user.
Then install run as root or via sudo `make full-install`.
Finally enable and start ctguard: `systemctl enable ctguard-*` and `systemctl start ctguard-*`.

To deinstall ctguard first stop its services: `systemctl stop ctguard-*`.
Now delete the remaining files: `rm -Rf /var/lib/ctguard /etc/ctguard /usr/sbin/ctguard-* /lib/systemd/system/ctguard-*`.
